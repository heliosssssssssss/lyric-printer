With my very long Github username, it would be unethical to make you have to type it out from a TikTok video. 

So.. I just gave you a short link, that in return gives you the repository to copy paste. 

If you do plan to fork this, and what not all I ask is you follow me and like my content. Nothing else. 

Thank you.
